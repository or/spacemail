*WARNING*: This repository is severely outdated and a bit messy. It started using Spacemacs,
but shifted towards Doom Emacs, without much explanation or separation. I'll archive it as it is
now and make a clean version for just Doom Emacs here: https://github.com/or/ormail

** Requirements
- isync
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ brew install isync
#+END_SRC
- notmuch
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ brew install notmuch
#+END_SRC
- [[http://growl.info/downloads][Growl]] and [[http://growl.info/downloads#growlnotify][GrowlNotify]]
- [[https://github.com/matryer/xbar][xbar]] [[https://github.com/matryer/xbar/releases/tag/v2.0.32-beta][v2.0-32 beta]] at time of writing (before that it was called [[https://github.com/matryer/bitbar][BitBar]] and I used [[https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta10][v2.0 beta 10]])
- psutil
#+begin_src sh
pip install psutil
#+end_src

** Installation
*** xbar
Symlink the files in xbar-plugins into =~/Library/Application
Support/xbar/plugins= and start xbar.
*** Emacs
- Doom Emacs: symlink =lib/spacemail= into your doom directory and add =(load!
  "spacemail/spacemail")= to your =config.el=
- Spacemacs: add =lib/spacemail/packages.el=
*** isync
**** Retrieving credentials via macOS Keychain (recommended)
- use the =UseKeychain= setting, see [[https://www.mankier.com/1/mbsync][mbsync man page]] for details
- more secure than the GPG method below

**** Retrieving credentials via GPG (discouraged)
- =pinentry-mac= for GPG to ask for the password when decrypting
  =~/.authinfo.gpg=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ brew install pinentry-mac
#+END_SRC
- anyone with access to your system while you are logged in will be able to run
  =gpg -d ~/.authinfo.gpg= to retrieve the password

*** Alternative setup with offlineimap
Previously I used offlineimap, but isync is faster and allows the more secure
Keychain access. However, offlineimap can still be used like before, see the git
history to see what changes might be necessary.

*** Migrate from offlineimap
1. Backup your mail directory
2. Delete your mail directory
3. Set up mbsync with the same mail directory
4. Run mbsync, which fetches all mails again
5. Run notmuch-poll, everything should work as expected afterwards, files
   previously archived will have the offlineimap naming scheme, but notmuch
   isn't fussy about that

** Options
If you want to archive all email that is older than 30 days, then you can
add this to =~/.spacemailrc=:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE ini
[general]
archive = true
#+END_QUOTE

Archiving will move old emails to a local folder, so mbsync will delete
them on the server on the next sync.
